the study shows the statistical analysis of Rotarod test result to evaluate the effect of anisense oligoneuclotide injection in motor coordination, balance an endurance in 35 taupathy mice, P301S transgene in chronic study 
over 12 weeks, performing test in week1, week 4, week8, week 12.
the result of two-way ANOVA shows:All main effects and interactions are highly significant (p<0.001), Treatment explains 97.3% of variance (ges=0.973) → Most influential factorLarge interaction effect → Treatment differences change over time
the post-hoc test results indicates that WT mice: Stable high performance (long latency to fall), P301S_Vehicle:Severe motor deficits (64.6s worse than WT at week 2),Progressive decline over 12 weeks 
P301S_ASO:Significant improvement over Vehicle by week 4 (24.4s better), Partial rescue of motor deficits (difference from WT would be smaller than Vehicle)
Key Conclusions:The ASO treatment significantly attenuates motor deficits in P301S mice, Treatment effects emerge by week 4 and persist through chronic study, While improved, ASO group doesn't fully reach WT performance levels (would need WT vs ASO comparison)
